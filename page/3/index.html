        <p>Was talking to one of my colleagues in a different team after 5pm and he said he was doing some work with <a href="https://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/" target="_blank" rel="external">Ext JS</a>. Like any self respecting engineeer who had no idea what the person talking to them was talking about, I asked my dear Uncle Google. One of their selling points is <strong><em>Ext JS features hundreds of high-performance UI widgets</em></strong>, now please don’t question this, but this selling point made me think <em>“I’m going to go home and make a Family Tree web app”</em>. Don’t you love it when an idea just pops into your head!</p>
<p>Now my confidence is still a little shakey when it comes to coding, however it is growing more and more each day. So whilst stuck at Highbury and Islington (thanks TFL!) I looked up the perfect Javascript library for me to use, <a href="http://d3js.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">D3.js</a> if you are interested, and as soon as I got home I jumped on <a href="http://codepen.io/" target="_blank" rel="external">CodePen</a> and got started.  </p>

        <p>Not sure if I told you before, but I used to work in television. Since leaving that world my focus has been on all things client-server side, so have been paying very little attention to the world of entertainment (apart from the <a href="http://www.bravotv.com/the-real-housewives-of-atlanta" target="_blank" rel="external">Real Housewives of Atlanta</a>…don’t judge). On January 14th I happened to go on <a href="https://twitter.com/tanya_powell" target="_blank" rel="external">twitter</a> to see what was trending and saw #OscarsSoWhite. My reaction was simply <em>“erm…ok”</em>. Was I surprised? My good god NO! But here’s my initial question…why do we only talk this once a year? Movies come out throughout the 12 months.</p>
<p><img src="http://cdn.snarkfood.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/netzreporter-oscarssowhite-100-_v-standard644_eb9b19-470x264.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I’m an uncompromising proud black woman, however I don’t think this is a <strong><em>“black thing”</em></strong>, I think this is a minority issue (which is actually a joke, because collectively us minorities are the majority). If you are not caucasian then you are dismissed. Why Blacktors like Jada Pinkett-Smith has decided that this year she’s going to boycott is beyond me, they should’ve been boycotting for years! This treatment is not new. The sad truth is us minorities have to work harder than our counterparts to be counted and considered, and this is not just in the world of entertainment this is across all industries.</p>
<p>I was once asked if I thought I had gotten a job because I’m a black woman. I said no, I got the job I’m an asset who happens to be a black woman. Was I upset by this question? Nope! I knew she was just threatened and needed a poor excuse to make her feel better about her shallow insecurities.</p>
<p><em>(Ok, enough about my life and back to my point.)</em></p>
<p>So yes, the Oscars are oh so so white, but so is our mainstream culture. Will Black Actors boycotting this year’s Oscars make a positive difference? Not necessarily. Next year there probably <em>will</em> be <em>a</em> black nominee in the acting categories, but they will always wonder if it was for the talent or some sort of Academy guilt.</p>
<p>I would love love LOVE for my beautiful Black people to turn this into a positive. If mainstream culture won’t accept us for who we are then maybe we should stop trying to be mainstream and do things for ourselves. I’ve had this conversation with people so many times, but maybe this is the time where we really start supporting one another and stop settling for this nonsense treatment. It’s time for a change.</p>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>Ok let’s start with some honesty, my hair is a damn mess right now. I haven’t taken care of it <strong>FOR</strong> months! Today is Monday and I haven’t ran a comb or brush since Friday morning. Yes I am ashamed, but you know…the first step is admittance.</p>
<p>At the moment my hair is dry + dry + dry = <strong><em>DRY</em></strong>. So how am I going to remedy this? By doing a homemade <a href="https://uk.pinterest.com" target="_blank" rel="external">Pinterest</a> hair conditioning mask of course.</p>
<h3 id="Ingredients"><a href="#Ingredients" class="headerlink" title="Ingredients:"></a>Ingredients:</h3><ul>
<li>Coconut Oil</li>
<li>Egg Yolk</li>
<li>Avocado</li>
<li>Honey</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Coconut-Oil"><a href="#Coconut-Oil" class="headerlink" title="Coconut Oil"></a>Coconut Oil</h3><p><img src="https://www.organicfacts.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Coconut-and-Coconut-Oil.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>This has been a hair trend for a minute now, but do you know what the benefits are? Coconut oil stimulates hair growth by getting deep into follicles. It promotes a healthy scalp and moisturises a dry scalp. Coconut oil adds luster, shine and softness to the hair whilst prevents hair breakage and split ends, contributing to hair length.</p>
<h3 id="Egg-Yolk"><a href="#Egg-Yolk" class="headerlink" title="Egg Yolk"></a>Egg Yolk</h3><p><img src="http://partygirlfit.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/egg-yolk.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>Egg yolks contain a high concentration of proteins, vitamins and nutrients. As a result it works as a natural conditioner resulting in smooth and shiny hair. The fatty acids can fight against dandruff and has amazing effects on dry, damaged hair. The vitamin A, D and E in eggs, helps in preventing hair loss, and at the same time they protect hair from pollution and UV rays.</p>
<h3 id="Avocado"><a href="#Avocado" class="headerlink" title="Avocado"></a>Avocado</h3><p><img src="http://img.allw.mn/content/www/2010/02/7-best-home-made-hair-masks/avocado-and-mayo-mask_best-home-made-hair-masks.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Avocado contains many proteins and vitamins, including A, D, E and B6 as well as magnesium, folic acid, amino acids, copper and iron, all of which can help with both hair growth and nourishment.</p>
<h3 id="Honey"><a href="#Honey" class="headerlink" title="Honey"></a>Honey</h3><p><img src="http://i.ehow.co.uk/images/a04/88/ge/put-honey-hair-800X800.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Honey is a natural humectant, honey attracts moisture. It’s also full of antioxidants and nutrients to feed hair follicles that house the live part of hair, encouraging hair growth. That being said, it also needs a medium to help spread it around, otherwise you can end up with just a sticky mess, so the recipes include other natural ingredients that help you restore dry hair to a health and luster, from the scalp up.</p>
<h2 id="What-did-I-do"><a href="#What-did-I-do" class="headerlink" title="What did I do?"></a>What did I do?</h2><p>So I mixed them all together without measuring (it’s my Jamaican way, we don’t measure we just pour!), but I did warm up the Coconut Oil so it was solid rather than liquid. I’m going to leave it on overnight, wake up early and wash it out, then do my usual co-wash.</p>
<p>Girls this works a treat and I highly recommend it. Our hair needs protein and moisture, especially in this weather. Give it a go and let me know what you think x</p>

        <p>The definition of chic is “<strong><em>elegantly and stylishly fashionable</em></strong>“”. </p>
<p>Last week my homie <a href="https://isanynamefree.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Gillian</a> emailed me a link to blog post titled <a href="http://www.gal-dem.com/this-black-woman-had-her-job-offer-revoked-due-to-her-hairstyle-and-were-mad/" target="_blank" rel="external">“This Black Woman Had Her Job Offer Revoked Due To Her Hairstyle and We’re Mad”</a>. Before I even read the post I both KMT (that’s kissed my teeth for those not up to date with urban vernacular) and SMFH (that’s shake my f**king head). We are in 2015, right? There are some White Women in the public eye who have also chosen to adopt this look of wearing their hair in braids, so why can’t this educated Black Woman wear her neat and tidy braids to work?</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*BftW9dBwRqWTac9oENa2aw.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="And-it-begins"><a href="#And-it-begins" class="headerlink" title="And it begins"></a>And it begins</h3><p>A few months ago I was developing an online lifestyle publication for a Sri Lankan friend of mine and she got some amazing support. I said to <a href="https://isanynamefree.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Gillian</a> at the time if either of us, as Black Women, were to do something similar do you think we’d get the same amount of support? </p>
<p>I’ve always strived for equal rights for all, regardless of race, gender, religious beliefs or sexual orientation. If you’re a good person then you’re good with me. However, recently I’ve become increasingly fed up with one particular group being constantly sidelined – Black Women.</p>
<p>I know there are plenty of Black Women in the UK doing incredible things and I want the world to see our amazing accomplishments. We are lawyers, doctors, scientists, artists, chefs and so much more. </p>
<h3 id="No-longer-will-I-sit-and-hope-someone-else-will-try-and-make-a-change-I-need-to-do-this-myself"><a href="#No-longer-will-I-sit-and-hope-someone-else-will-try-and-make-a-change-I-need-to-do-this-myself" class="headerlink" title="No longer will I sit and hope someone else will try and make a change. I need to do this myself"></a>No longer will I sit and hope someone else will try and make a change. I need to do this myself</h3><p>The aim of <a href="https://medium.com/black-girl-chic" target="_blank" rel="external">Black Girl Chic</a> is to collate and share the stories of the modern Black Woman living in the UK. Our struggles are real and our achievements should be celebrated. </p>
<p>If the definition of chic is <em>elegantly and stylishly fashionable</em> then that’s exactly what the modern Black Woman is; she’s always elegant, she’s always stylish and her brilliance will never go out of fashion.</p>

        <p>So much for the sisterhood! No matter how well I do in life I try not to brag. I just humble myself, try and help out others and continue doing me. But there’s always got to be one chick who has to try and dig at you simply because she’s not you.</p>
<p>I grew up on a council estate, raised by two immigrant parents, got a brother who became a father at barely 19 and was told I’d be pushing a pram by the time I was 16 by my <a href="www.dianeabbott.org.uk/">local MP</a>. Yet here I stand with two degrees and a mortgage; and did it all by myself. Still talk like I’m chilling on the wall <em>wid da men dem doe</em>.</p>
<p>I was nominated to feature in a newsletter (that I work on) for women in tech as the nominator thought the story of my career transition could be inspiring. I was shocked as it came from nowhere and replied with an <em>“erm…”</em>. Sometimes you need a humble brag and I’ve now realised it is a story that can inspire others. The so-called editor replied with a laughing emoji. I know better than to react to that so I sat back and waited to see what happened next. The nominator then further explained why she nominated<br>me and the so-called editor responded with <em>“actually I want to feature person X because of amazing blog post about us”</em>.</p>
<p><img src="http://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/cache/17/47/17474d3a52fd7efdada7b5896b5c5906.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Ok I had to Google person X’s <em>‘amazing blog post’</em> it could be some good stuff. I read the post and yes it was good, but it wasn’t about us, we were mentioned at the tail end of a sentence. I then began reflecting on all the times she was rude to me or tried to micro manage me and it hit me, she’s jealous and doesn’t want me to get more attention to her. Pathetic I know, but true.</p>
<p>I’m also in charge of the social media marketing for this women in tech organisation. Later that afternoon one of the other ladies asked me to tweet a photo they took from the official account. The so-called editor then took it upon herself to try and micro manage me one more time and tell me to tweet it with certain conditions. I shook my head and ignored her, she has nothing to do with the social media, she just wanted to throw her weight.</p>
<p>I work in an industry with an issue with diversity, not only a gender issue but a race issue too. Unfortunately (or I’d like to think fortunately) I tick two of those boxes, I’m a black female and so is the so-called editor. You’d think that when we are truly the minorities (<a href="http://www.techrepublic.com/article/the-state-of-women-in-technology-15-data-points-you-should-know/" target="_blank" rel="external">black women only occupy roughly 3% of the job roles in tech in the US</a>, would love to know the stats for the UK) we’d try to uplift one another instead of trying to bring each other down. It’s a shame because I’ve now decided to stop working on the newsletter and concentrate on my other projects. I don’t need to spend my spare time looking over my shoulder waiting for her to eventually stab me in the back.</p>
<p>What do you think? Am I over reacting?</p>
