Ok wow! Really didn't expect my career change post to resonate with people. I guess it's something everyone can relate to, as it's not just a story of changing careers but a story of making a life change.

Nandhini (one of the founders of [WHFNP](http://womenhackfornonprofits.com/)) just asked me an important question and I wanted to share the answer with the world.

**How did you keep your motivation when you know the job was rotting you?**

I had to remind myself everyday

> There has to be more to life than ***this***

**This** can be anything that's causing you unhappiness in your life and I had to believe I deserved better. I also had to stop **being comfortable *being* uncomfortable**. Do you know what I mean? I had to make that rotting feeling uncomfortable again, stop being complacent and take ownership of my future. No one was going to make the change for me were they? Only I could do it and once I truly believed I deserved better and that _daily_ feeling of absolute discomfort was back that was all the motivation I needed.

I was constantly on websites dissecting their functionality and thinking _"wish I could do that"_ knowing that if I stayed where I was it was highly unlikely to happen. As my confidence began growing I realised _"I think I can make that"_. I'm slowly getting to the point where can say _"I'm going to make that"_ and hopefully as it grows more I'll one day say _"I can make that better"_. I can't allow myself to become complacent ever again <i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i>
