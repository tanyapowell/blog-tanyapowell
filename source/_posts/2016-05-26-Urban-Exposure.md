This morning I bumped into a woman (a few years older than me), that I grew up with and haven't seen since I was about 12 years old. After exchanging a few pleasantries - how's mum? how's dad? etc - she then asked what I do for a living. When I told her she had one of the most confused looks I've ever seen.

**Me**: “Why have you got such a confused look on your face?”

**Her**: “Software engineering, that's so different”

**Me**: “Good different though. Hang on, what do you mean by different? Cos your face is saying ‘this girl is weird’”

**Her**: “Well it is weird”

**Me**: “Why is it weird? I don't understand”

I did understand. I just wanted her to say it. I needed to hear the words come out of her mouth.

**Her**: “It’s not traditional. *We* don't do that. *We* do hairdressing or construction. *We* are not exposed to those sort of things”

**Me**: “Not sure who *we* are”

I knew fully well who *we* are!

**Me**: “But I am a software engineer and this is what I do”

**Her**: “You know, people like us. Black people or people from an estate. We do traditional jobs like admin, hairdressing or construction. Us teachers and us parents are not exposed or equipped to tell our kids about these sort of roles”

I've heard this before and if I had the time I may have had some nice choice words for her. Does she spout this to her students? **"Limit yourself, that's the only way to get through life"**. But I needed to get work so diplomacy was my option.

**Me**: “I wasn't exposed to this world when I was growing up. Fortunately I'm single minded enough to have found my own path to follow. You're right we need to expose kids, parents and teachers in poorer communities to these sort of roles. You're a teacher and a mother and now you know someone relatable in the field who can introduce kids to tech. I'm living breathing proof that *we* can do it. And now you have no excuse not to inform your own children and students about the world of computer science. Here I am, I am your resource. Let me help you, so you can help them”

Welcome to The Intersections of Tech series. I'll be giving my unique perspective on being a women of colour in tech in the UK. I am hoping to bring more awareness and promote the opportunities that this sector offers to women of colour, so that they know that *we* can do it.

If we want to improve diversity in tech we can't forget about all of the intersections, can we?
