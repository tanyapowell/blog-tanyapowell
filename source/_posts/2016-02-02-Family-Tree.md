Was talking to one of my colleagues in a different team after 5pm and he said he was doing some work with [Ext JS](https://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/). Like any self respecting engineeer who had no idea what the person talking to them was talking about, I asked my dear Uncle Google. One of their selling points is ***Ext JS features hundreds of high-performance UI widgets***, now please don't question this, but this selling point made me think *"I'm going to go home and make a Family Tree web app"*. Don't you love it when an idea just pops into your head!

Now my confidence is still a little shakey when it comes to coding, however it is growing more and more each day. So whilst stuck at Highbury and Islington (thanks TFL!) I looked up the perfect Javascript library for me to use, [D3.js](http://d3js.org/) if you are interested, and as soon as I got home I jumped on [CodePen](http://codepen.io/) and got started.

I've only just started, but what do you think?
