<!-- Content -->
<p>The lovely <a href="http://dionnecondor-farrell.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Dionne</a> (who I met a few months back at <a href="http://womenhackfornonprofits.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">WHFNP</a>) read my post about my <a href="http://blog.tanyapowell.co.uk/Making-The-Transition/">career change</a> and had <strong>10</strong> questions for me. Rather than simply answering her she suggested I answer her questions in a blog post for the world to see. This is going to be a long post so you may want to make a cup of tea and grab some biscuits first.</p>
<p><strong>How long were you working in TV?</strong></p>
<p>I started at the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="external">BBC</a> in 2008 as a Screening Co-ordinator, which a glamorous way of saying I made DVD screeners of all the BBC catalogue and sent them out to potential distributors around the globe. In 2009 my contract came to an end and in a panic I applied for an Assistant Presentation Scheduler role not having a clue what the job was. The Presentation team was split into two, one team looked after the BBC channels and the other half looked after <a href="http://network.uktv.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="external">UKTV</a> channels. After 18 months I was promoted to Presentation Scheduler, eventually becoming the team’s tech support and <em>Deputy</em> team leader. In total I worked in TV for 7 years.</p>
<p><strong>How easy was it to get on a MSc course?</strong></p>
<p>To do my MSc I had to have a BSc in a Computer Science related subject, submit an essay of why I wanted to do the course and then fill in a form. As simple as that.</p>
<p><strong>Why that particular course?</strong></p>
<p>I wanted to continue working full time as I was saving for a mortgage deposit at the same time so the course I chose had to be part time and in the evening. Started looking into part time Computer Science related course and found out the <a href="https://www.westminster.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="external">University of Westminster</a> did an evening Software Engineering Masters. I compared the MSc Computer Science and MSc Software Engineering courses and the only two differences seemed to be that Software Engineering offered a part time course with an emphasis on software efficiency and algorithms. Being the nutjob I am I thought why take the easy road when I can study algorithms and use that brain of mine.</p>
<p><strong>How did you fund the course fees?</strong></p>
<p>I was already saving for a mortgage deposit so fortunately I had some money stashed. I continued working full time to help fund the course. This also meant retakes were not an option because I was not paying to redo anything.</p>
<p><strong>What was it like studying part-time and holding down a full time job?</strong></p>
<p>It was an adjustment. I knew that it meant no social life for two years and I was fine with that. I initially thought I’d go two evenings a week 6pm-10pm, then spend my Sundays doing work and that would be it. Well I was wrong. On days I had lectures I had to prepare for them the night <em>before</em>, and also prep lunch AND dinner to bring to work so I could eat before attending. So on days I went to uni I would leave home at 7:45am and get home around 11pm, then go to bed around 1am after prepping for the next day. Like I said it was an adjustment and I had no choice but to be organised.</p>
<p><strong>How long did it take you to get new job in a new industry after graduation?</strong></p>
<p>I got my new job end of April 2015 (didn’t start until August 2015 as I had a 3 month notice period). I finished my MSc in September 2014, graduating November 2014. I spent October 2014 in Educador and Peru traveling, and came back even more exhausted than when I left. A lot was going on at work during September - December 2014 as my team was in the process of being tuped and I was the <em>Deputy</em> Team Leader so I didn’t start looking until January 2015. I was fortunate as it only took me 4 months.</p>
<p><strong>How did you go about the job hunt?</strong></p>
<p>At the beginning of my job hunt I made the decision that I wanted to stay in an industry similar to TV, i.e. relaxed and informal. I don’t do well in corporate environments. This meant I was applying for roles in more of the Creative Industries so I targeted more creative companies.</p>
<p><strong>What was the interview process like?</strong></p>
<p>For every role I went for the process was the same:</p>
<ul>
<li>Informal phone interview</li>
<li>Technical task</li>
<li>Face to Face interview</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s important to remember this, just because we write code doesn’t mean we are computers. We’re human, personable and can have conversations. Remind your interviewer of that!</p>
<p><strong>How did you make yourself stand out from the crowd?</strong></p>
<p>My CV is awful and so is my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tanyapowell" target="_blank" rel="external">LinkedIn</a> profile, but they do show that I am a multi-faceted person. Yes, I can write code, but I can do other things as well. My current boss noticed that about my CV.</p>
<p><strong>What does your new role involve, how is it keeping your mind from rotting again?</strong></p>
<p>At the moment I’m doing Front-End on a game. I get to make a game! I’d never learnt JavaScript before so this is a good learning opportunity. I’m actively encouraged to learn new technologies and contribute to open source projects. On Thursday I even reported an iOS 9 Chrome bug to Google who then passed it onto Apple. I know it sounds ridiculous but without my team’s encouragement I would’ve been too shy to do that.</p>
<p>When I can I help the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_assurance" target="_blank" rel="external">QAs</a> so that I can be develop a QA mindset so I can be a more efficient Engineer. On Fridays I work on a separate project with some other newbies and I’m their <a href="https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/scrum/scrummaster" target="_blank" rel="external">Scrum Master</a> so that is a whole new learning curve.  </p>

<p>Hope that helped <a href="http://dionnecondor-farrell.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Dionne</a> <i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i></p>
