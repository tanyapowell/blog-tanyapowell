Grid Layout is a new layout model for CSS. It has the ability to control both the sizing and positioning of boxes and their contents.

## Grid Layout vs Flexbox
You may have heard of Flexbox and think this is the same thing, but itâ€™s not. It differs from ***Flexible Box Layout*** (Flexbox) as it is optimised for two-dimensional layouts and Flexbox is ideal for single-axis alignment.

Layouts can be articulated with either Grid or Flexbox as they both have their own specialities:

| **Grid**                                 | **Flexbox**                                                                   |
| :--------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Enforces two-dimensional alignment       | Focuses of space distribution on a single axis                                |
| Uses a top-down approach                 | Uses a simpler bottom-up approach                                             |
| Allows for explicit overlapping of items | Can use a content-size based line-wrapping system to control a secondary axis |
| Has more powerful spanning capabilities  |
