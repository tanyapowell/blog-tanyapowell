title: Live - How to Blog with WHFNP
---
Last week a few of us who volunteer at [Women Hack for Non-Profits](http://www.womenhackfornonprofits.com/) (WHFNP) were asked to present a workshop on how to blog. Yes, blogging is subjective, but where or how do you begin? What do people in technology like to read? Can I write about my personal journey in the wonderful world of technology? It's our aim to answers these questions and more.

We contacted a couple of our favourite tech bloggers ([Ben Nadel](http://www.bennadel.com) and [Miss Geeky](https://missgeeky.com/)) who offered us some tips, such as:

- Keep a backlog of ideas that you want to explore
- It never will be perfect

We promptly put together some slides - [which of course we've open sourced](http://bit.ly/whfnp-blogging) - including some of our tips, their tips and blogs we find inspiring.

[Krissy](https://medium.com/@krissygoround) had the great idea of live blogging during the workshop and that's where this takes an interesting turn. After spending Monday speaking to my always encouraging friend Liza, I volunteered to do live blog throughout the night. So let's begin...

## 18:39
Matt from GoCardless gives us a warm introduction. Thanks for hosting us

## 18:43
Nandhini starts the evening off by updating all attendees with updates from the org
- Fashion Revolution Wall went live
- Volunteers Krissy, Tanya and Elizabeth were actively involved in the successful EmpowerHack hackathon earlier this month
- We are turning 1 yr old next month! Help us celebrate

## 18:48
Krissy and Elizabeth get things going with the blogging night, by telling the attendees how to access our open source slides.

## 18:51
Why should you blog? Here are some reason:
- It's a learning aid
- It connect you to a network of like minded people
- Women are underrepresented in the tech-blogosphere. We need to speak up
- It can open up opportunities for you

## 18:54
Krissy talks about her love for Ben Nadel and how grateful we are for his tips and words of wisdom. She also tells of her next blog post...it'll be about _the lady she saw on the train with a pineapple_. Best to tweet her for details on that one...

## 18:58
Who is Miss Geeky? Elizabeth goes through all the incredible tips Miss Geeky shared with us late last night.
- Refactor and re-write
- Use sticky notes

## 19:01
Why do Krissy and Elizabeth blog? Elizabeth used it as a tool to change careers from a developer to UX. Krissy blogs about her love of dev and dance. However, sometimes they write raw, emotional pieces about the experiences they go through. Krissy said she is trying to blog more about technology and is working on a series - Dev and Dance - and how they correlate (you'd be surprised!).

#### What makes a good blog topic?
It's up to you. It's all subjective, but know who your audience is and cater your terminology for them.

## 19:07
Now it's over to you! Time to split into groups and start thinking of blog topics to work on this evening. Example broad topics include:
- Giving a technical tutorial
- Tips relating to the tech industry
- Observations relating to the tech industry
- Personal story/your journey in tech
- Recap a tech event
By the end of the night teams should have started a blog post and if completed they will appear on the WHFNP [blog](https:blog.womenhackfornonprofits.com) tonight!

***ADVICE FROM THE AUDIENCE*** - always post on your personal blog before reposting on [Medium](https://medium.com/) for better SEO.

## 19:14 - Pizza TIME!
