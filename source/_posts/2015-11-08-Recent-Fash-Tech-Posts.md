Fashion Technology FASCINATES me! It combines two of my loves. In September I attended a Fashion Technology Startup Wekend and my team came second place (you can read about my team's success in this [medium](https://medium.com) post by my teammate [Nafisa](https://twitter.com/Nafisa_B_) - [54 hours of FashTech](https://medium.com/@Nafisa_B/54-hours-of-fashtech-28a98b7f8cd0) - she writes so eloquently <i class="fa fa-heart"></i>).

Here are a couple of posts I've written for [Bellaviee](http://www.bellaviee.com) recently:


- *[Fashion Meets Technology](http://www.bellaviee.com/style/fashion-meet-technology/)*
- *[What exactly is Smart Jewellery?](http://www.bellaviee.com/style/what-exactly-is-smart-jewellery/)*


Hit me up on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tanya_powell) if you want to know more about Fashion Tech, any events coming up or if you want to teach me a thing or two. I'd love to hear from you
