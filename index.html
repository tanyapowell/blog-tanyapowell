        <p>So the title could be a teeny weeny bit misleading, especially if you’re anything like me and spend far too much time following the <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=caitlyn+jenner+transition" target="_blank" rel="external">Caitlyn Jenner</a> transition from being Bruce or watching random <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree" target="_blank" rel="external">BBC Three</a> documentaries. This is not my coming out post. I have nothing to come out of! The transition I’m refering to is my career transition.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.personalbrandingblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/shutterstock_160935986-300x199.jpg" alt="Career Change"></p>
<p>This chapter of my life started in 2012. I was working as a Presentation Scheduler on <a href="http://alibi.uktv.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="external">Alibi</a> making sure all the commercial breaks, sponsorship, branding and most importantly the programmes were in the correct order and duration. I LOVE my old colleagues but the job was monotonous and my brain started to rot. At this time I was encouraged to change careers and start using my intelligence.</p>
<p>Ok so what’s a girl to do with her life:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><s>Chef,</s></em></li>
<li><em><s>Professional Photographer,</s></em></li>
<li><em><s>Professional Blogger,</s></em></li>
<li><em><s>Marketer</s></em></li>
</ul>
<p>Or I could <strong>make things with computers</strong></p>
<p>In September 2012 I began my MSc in Software Engineering as a part time student whilst continuing my full time job as a Presentation Scheduler and graduated 10th November 2014 with a merit. Since then I have a new career as a full time Software Engineer and have been doing side projects ever since.</p>
<p>Welcome to my new life as a #womenintech and a Software Engineer.</p>

        <p>Fashion Technology FASCINATES me! It combines two of my loves. In September I attended a Fashion Technology Startup Wekend and my team came second place (you can read about my team’s success in this <a href="https://medium.com" target="_blank" rel="external">medium</a> post by my teammate <a href="https://twitter.com/Nafisa_B_" target="_blank" rel="external">Nafisa</a> - <a href="https://medium.com/@Nafisa_B/54-hours-of-fashtech-28a98b7f8cd0" target="_blank" rel="external">54 hours of FashTech</a> - she writes so eloquently <i class="fa fa-heart"></i>).</p>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>Well, this has been a weird year. I’m sure you’ll remember it fondly. Usually, at this time of year, I like to reflect on the year and thinking of ways I can improve myself.</p>
<h1 id="The-year-that-was-2016"><a href="#The-year-that-was-2016" class="headerlink" title="The year that was 2016"></a>The year that was 2016</h1><p><img src="http://i.giphy.com/qTBA8TwRnFsY0.gif" alt="new year countdown"></p>
<p>Ok, I’m not going to talk about the obvious rant worthy things. Why? It takes too much energy and to be honest, I’m trying to forget them. What I will say about 2016 is that I have definitely become more comfortable with voicing my opinions. My voice has grown (both tech-wise and in non-tech ways) and fingers crossed it will be louder. It’s simple to say that this year I’ve grown as a person and as a developer.</p>
<p>Also, I’m now a complete JavaScript convert. If you asked me if I’d ever predominately code in JavaScript 14 months ago, I would’ve laughed in your face.</p>
<h1 id="Goals-for-2017"><a href="#Goals-for-2017" class="headerlink" title="Goals for 2017"></a>Goals for 2017</h1><p><img src="http://i.giphy.com/3o6UB9IxAjNdyIgUKY.gif" alt="2017"></p>
<p>Apart from the obvious (continue to be incredible, amazing and fabulous), I do have a few small and attainable techie and non-techie goals for the year. They’re not resolutions, just things that I would like to do in the next 12 months. Ok, that sounds like resolutions. Hopefully, you know what I mean.</p>
<h2 id="Techie-Goals"><a href="#Techie-Goals" class="headerlink" title="Techie Goals"></a>Techie Goals</h2><h3 id="Blog-more"><a href="#Blog-more" class="headerlink" title="Blog more"></a>Blog more</h3><p>I like to write, but I have been an unorganised clutz. This means I haven’t found the time to write. In 2017 I’m aiming to be more organised and schedule the time to blog more. What will I be writing about? I’ll be focussing on coding, my life as a dev and technical writing. But, there’s much more to tech than just those topics.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.giphy.com/3o7qDHsfqqsgrbP78Y.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>I’m fortunate that I get to play with new frontend frameworks and tech at work. Next year I’ll be writing about these new frontend technologies and letting you know my opinions. I’ll continue writing about my journey as a developer too. It’s a scary world to enter, but fingers crossed I can be a friendly and relatable voice.</p>
<p>Expect a post once a month. And if you notice that I haven’t posted one, feel free to publicly shame me on <a href="https://twitter.com/tanya_powell" target="_blank" rel="external">twitter</a> lol.</p>
<h3 id="Finish-off-a-couple-of-personal-projects"><a href="#Finish-off-a-couple-of-personal-projects" class="headerlink" title="Finish off a couple of personal projects"></a>Finish off a couple of personal projects</h3><p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/aeIuSiMkcTsRO/source.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>How many times have you started a project and not completed it? Is your GitHub a cemetery of dead, uncompleted projects? Yep, I know the feeling. Next year I’m going to complete at least two projects that I have started before I start anything new. I know, I know, it’s easier said than done. Especially when you have a notebook of ideas.</p>
<h4 id="What-projects-do-I-want-to-complete"><a href="#What-projects-do-I-want-to-complete" class="headerlink" title="What projects do I want to complete?"></a>What projects do I want to complete?</h4><ul>
<li><p><strong>Recipe Chrome Extension</strong> - I’m a foodie and I’ve had in mind to create some sort of recipe chrome extension. Haven’t fleshed out the details (and I’m not going to tell you it either haha), but the repo exists and it will benefit me (and hopefully others too). If you already use one, let me know. I always value other opinions.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Meal Planner app</strong> - remember in my first goal I said I’m aiming to be more organised? Fingers crossed this app will help me. Yeah, I can use google spreadsheets or an existing app, but where’s the fun in that?</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Afro Kouture</strong> - I’m a black woman who proudly wears her natural curls, despite going against the norm of our superficial western society. At times it is frustrating and finding information results in me spending hours upon hours scrolling through Google. This app will hopefully bring the information I need for my natural curls to me and others; and save us from spending hours on Google.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Contribute-to-more-open-source-software"><a href="#Contribute-to-more-open-source-software" class="headerlink" title="Contribute to more open source software"></a>Contribute to more open source software</h3><p><img src="http://i.giphy.com/l46Cbqvg6gxGvh2PS.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>Like many, I am a frequent user of open source software. Having worked on open source projects in the past I can say it’s not easy. You come home from work tired and the last thing you want to do is pick up an issue in GitHub and solve it. Open source contributors work hard and if I can help, then help I will.</p>
<p>Contributing to open source software doesn’t necessarily mean I will be writing lines and lines of code. I could be writing documentation or reviewing some code.</p>
<p>One open source project I will be working on is <a href="http://empowerhack.io/#drawmylife" target="_blank" rel="external">Draw My Life</a>. Our little project has expanded a lot over the past six months and I can see it becoming bigger. Next year we will be doing some data visualisation and building a team hub.</p>
<p>We’re always looking for people to help, so if you would like to contribute just holla.</p>
<h3 id="Tweet-more"><a href="#Tweet-more" class="headerlink" title="Tweet more"></a>Tweet more</h3><p><img src="http://i.giphy.com/v1DMXPujFEtzy.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>Haha, yes, I plan on being more visible on social media. Do you really need me to tweet more? Of course you do. Plus everyone loves gifs. Expect more tweets, more gifs and more all round Tanya-ness. Condensed into 140 characters.</p>
<h2 id="Non-techie-Goals"><a href="#Non-techie-Goals" class="headerlink" title="Non-techie Goals"></a>Non-techie Goals</h2><p><img src="http://i.giphy.com/3oz8xxN7ecNCdyXbG0.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>I realised this year it is VERY important to have me time and have a balance between tech stuff and non-tech stuff. I’ve neglected other aspects of my personality and have become mentally exhausted. I need my chill time, friends and family time, and other fun activity time.</p>
<h3 id="Cooking-more-and-Kitchen-Diva"><a href="#Cooking-more-and-Kitchen-Diva" class="headerlink" title="Cooking more and Kitchen Diva"></a>Cooking more and Kitchen Diva</h3><p>I’ve got a Pinterest board full of recipes to try out and I can’t wait. Some people hate cooking. Not me, I love it. I find it relaxing, therapeutic and creative. I’m starting to sound like a broken record but, with organisation and my meal planner app I’ll definitely find time to do it.</p>
<p>To keep me motivated I’ve even started a foodie instagram account - <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kitchen_diva_/" target="_blank" rel="external">Kitchen Diva</a>. Just like with my blogging I need accountability buddies. If you notice I haven’t been posting, I’m giving you permission to publicly shame me.</p>
<hr>
<p>What are your plans for 2017? I’d love to know, so why not <a href="https://twitter.com/tanya_powell" target="_blank" rel="external">tweet</a> me 😊</p>

      <a class="article-title" href="/2016/11/02/PWA/">Beginner&#39;s Guide to Progressive Web Apps</a>
    </h1>
  

      </header>
    
    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>Last week I attended <a href="http://www.deanhume.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Dean Hume’s</a> Progressive Web Apps for beginners talk. (Thanks to the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/London-JavaScript-Community/" target="_blank" rel="external">London Javascript Community</a> for setting it all up). During the talk, Dean provided us with an amazing reading list. This reading list contained the fundamentals of Progressive Web Apps and how to make your first one. Rather than keeping my notes in my notebook I thought I’d share them with you all.</p>
<h1 id="What-are-Progressive-Web-Apps"><a href="#What-are-Progressive-Web-Apps" class="headerlink" title="What are Progressive Web Apps?"></a>What are Progressive Web Apps?</h1><blockquote>
<p>Progressive Web Apps are experiences that combine the best of the web and the best of apps. They are useful to users from the very first visit in a browser tab, no install required. As the user progressively builds a relationship with the app over time, it becomes more and more powerful. It loads quickly, even on flaky networks, sends relevant push notifications, has an icon on the home screen, and loads as a top-level, full screen experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are three major benefits to using Progressive Web Apps for users:</p>
<ol>
<li>More engagement</li>
<li>Faster</li>
<li>Reliability Improvements</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Service-Workers"><a href="#Service-Workers" class="headerlink" title="Service Workers"></a>Service Workers</h2><p>Before discussing the user benefits of Progressive Web Apps it’s important to know what the key to them is - <strong>Service Workers</strong>.</p>
<p>A service worker is a script that stands between your website and the network, giving you, among other things, the ability to intercept network requests and respond to them in different ways.</p>
<p>Three things to know about Service Workers:</p>
<ol>
<li>They sit on a separate thread</li>
<li>They are HTTPS Only</li>
<li>They are the key to Progressive Web Apps</li>
</ol>
<p>For a more thorough explanation of Service Workers visit <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/02/making-a-service-worker/" target="_blank" rel="external">Making A Service Worker: A Case Study.</a></p>
<h2 id="App-Shell-Architecture"><a href="#App-Shell-Architecture" class="headerlink" title="App Shell Architecture"></a>App Shell Architecture</h2><blockquote>
<p>An application shell (or app shell) architecture is one way to build a Progressive Web App that reliably and instantly loads on your users’ screens, similar to what you see in native applications.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By using an app shell, your application will be fast as speed is its primary focus. The application shell should:</p>
<ol>
<li>Render and cache static content</li>
<li>Load quickly</li>
<li>Cache the shell loads</li>
<li>Dynamically display the apps content</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/images/2015/11/appshell/appshell-1.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><em>Recommended Reading: <a href="bit.ly/app-shell">bit.ly/app-shell</a></em></p>
<h1 id="User-Engagement"><a href="#User-Engagement" class="headerlink" title="User Engagement"></a>User Engagement</h1><p>Progressive Web Apps are not native mobile apps. So how can we create something that provides the same level (or better) of engagement that native apps do?</p>
<h2 id="Icons-and-Colours"><a href="#Icons-and-Colours" class="headerlink" title="Icons and Colours"></a>Icons and Colours</h2><p>By customising the icons and colours of your website you provide familiarity and increase engagement. This will lead to users returning to your website.</p>
<h3 id="Icons"><a href="#Icons" class="headerlink" title="Icons"></a>Icons</h3><p>When visiting your Progressive Web App, the browser will fetch an icon from the HTML. This icon will be used in various places, e.g. the browser tab, recent app switch, the new (or recently visited) tab page, and more.</p>
<p>To support all browsers the following tags should be added to the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of each page:</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">2</div><div class="line">3</div><div class="line">4</div><div class="line">5</div><div class="line">6</div><div class="line">7</div><div class="line">8</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">&lt;!-- icon in the highest resolution we need it for --&gt;</div><div class="line">&lt;link rel=&quot;icon&quot; sizes=&quot;192x192&quot; href=&quot;icon.png&quot;&gt;</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">&lt;!-- reuse same icon for Safari --&gt;</div><div class="line">&lt;link rel=&quot;apple-touch-icon&quot; href=&quot;ios-icon.png&quot;&gt;</div><div class="line">&lt;!-- multiple icons for IE --&gt;</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">&lt;meta name=&quot;msapplication-square310x310logo&quot; content=&quot;icon_largetile.png&quot;&gt;</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<h3 id="Colours"><a href="#Colours" class="headerlink" title="Colours"></a>Colours</h3><p>The browser (and some platform elements) can be modified by using different <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> tags. By modifying these the user’s experience can be vastly improved. Elements that can be changed include the address bar and the status bar on a mobile device.</p>
<p><img src="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/design-and-ui/browser-customization/imgs/status-bar-translucent-2x.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Using the <code>meta</code> tag <code>&lt;meta name=&quot;apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style&quot; content=&quot;black-translucent&quot;&gt;</code>the default status bar colour is changed to <code>black-translucent</code>.</p>

<h2 id="Push-Notifications"><a href="#Push-Notifications" class="headerlink" title="Push Notifications"></a>Push Notifications</h2><p>There are three parts to a Progressive Web App push Notification:</p>
<ol>
<li>Subscribe user</li>
<li>Save Subscription</li>
<li>Send notification from Google Cloud</li>
</ol>
<p>Fortunately for us Chrome has a <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/engage-and-retain/push-notifications/" target="_blank" rel="external">Web Push Notification API</a> that does the trick.</p>

<h1 id="More-Reliable-Application"><a href="#More-Reliable-Application" class="headerlink" title="More Reliable Application"></a>More Reliable Application</h1><h2 id="Caching"><a href="#Caching" class="headerlink" title="Caching"></a>Caching</h2><p>With Progressive Web Apps we are finally able to programmatically decide how to cache. Have no idea what I mean? Check out the recommended reading to fully understand.</p>
<p><em>Recommended Reading: <a href="bit.ly/sw-toolbox">bit.ly/sw-toolbox</a></em></p>
<h2 id="Save-Data-Header"><a href="#Save-Data-Header" class="headerlink" title="Save-Data Header"></a>Save-Data Header</h2><blockquote>
<p>The Save-Data client hint request header available in Chrome, Opera, and Yandex browsers enables developers to deliver fast and light applications to users who have opted-in to “data savings” mode in their browser.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This sounds great, but what does it mean? Simply put, if your site visitor has opted for this, they will receive a scaled down version of your site. They will not receive hi-resolution images (or perhaps no images at all), but they will still be able to access your site when their signal is low.</p>

Make sure to have a look through, I’m sure you’ll recognise a few.</p>

<p>All of the above only scratches the surface of Progressive Web Apps and how to get started. After attending this talk I’m definitely inspired to create my own and can see unlimited possibilities with them.</p>
<p>I’d love to know what are some of your favourite Progressive Web Apps? Have you ever built one? Were my notes useful? <a href="https://twitter.com/tanya_powell" target="_blank" rel="external">Tweet me</a> and let me know :)</p>

        <p>This morning I bumped into a woman (a few years older than me), that I grew up with and haven’t seen since I was about 12 years old. After exchanging a few pleasantries - how’s mum? how’s dad? etc - she then asked what I do for a living. When I told her she had one of the most confused looks I’ve ever seen.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.relatably.com/m/img/confused-memes/59582971.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Me</strong>: “Why have you got such a confused look on your face?”</p>
<p><strong>Her</strong>: “Software engineering, that’s so different”</p>
<p><strong>Me</strong>: “Good different though. Hang on, what do you mean by different? Cos your face is saying ‘this girl is weird’”</p>
<p><strong>Her</strong>: “Well it is weird”</p>
<p><strong>Me</strong>: “Why is it weird? I don’t understand”</p>
<p>I did understand. I just wanted her to say it. I needed to hear the words come out of her mouth.</p>
<p><strong>Her</strong>: “It’s not traditional. <em>We</em> don’t do that. <em>We</em> do hairdressing or construction. <em>We</em> are not exposed to those sort of things”</p>
<p><strong>Me</strong>: “Not sure who <em>we</em> are”</p>
<p>I knew fully well who <em>we</em> are!</p>
<p><strong>Me</strong>: “But I am a software engineer and this is what I do”</p>
<p><strong>Her</strong>: “You know, people like us. Black people or people from an estate. We do traditional jobs like admin, hairdressing or construction. Us teachers and us parents are not exposed or equipped to tell our kids about these sort of roles”</p>
<p>I’ve heard this before and if I had the time I may have had some nice choice words for her. Does she spout this to her students? <strong>“Limit yourself, that’s the only way to get through life”</strong>. But I needed to get work so diplomacy was my option.</p>
<p><strong>Me</strong>: “I wasn’t exposed to this world when I was growing up. Fortunately I’m single minded enough to have found my own path to follow. You’re right we need to expose kids, parents and teachers in poorer communities to these sort of roles. You’re a teacher and a mother and now you know someone relatable in the field who can introduce kids to tech. I’m living breathing proof that <em>we</em> can do it. And now you have no excuse not to inform your own children and students about the world of computer science. Here I am, I am your resource. Let me help you, so you can help them”</p>

<p>Welcome to The Intersections of Tech series. I’ll be giving my unique perspective on being a women of colour in tech in the UK. I am hoping to bring more awareness and promote the opportunities that this sector offers to women of colour, so that they know that <em>we</em> can do it.</p>
<p>If we want to improve diversity in tech we can’t forget about all of the intersections, can we?</p>
