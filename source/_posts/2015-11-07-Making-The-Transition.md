So the title could be a teeny weeny bit misleading, especially if you're anything like me and spend far too much time following the [Caitlyn Jenner](https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=caitlyn+jenner+transition) transition from being Bruce or watching random [BBC Three](http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree) documentaries. This is not my coming out post. I have nothing to come out of! The transition I'm refering to is my career transition.

This chapter of my life started in 2012. I was working as a Presentation Scheduler on [Alibi](http://alibi.uktv.co.uk/) making sure all the commercial breaks, sponsorship, branding and most importantly the programmes were in the correct order and duration. I LOVE my old colleagues but the job was monotonous and my brain started to rot. At this time I was encouraged to change careers and start using my intelligence.

Ok so what's a girl to do with her life:


- *<s>Chef,</s>*
- *<s>Professional Photographer,</s>*
- *<s>Professional Blogger,</s>*
- *<s>Marketer</s>*


Or I could **make things with computers**

In September 2012 I began my MSc in Software Engineering as a part time student whilst continuing my full time job as a Presentation Scheduler and graduated 10th November 2014 with a merit. Since then I have a new career as a full time Software Engineer and have been doing side projects ever since.

Welcome to my new life as a #womenintech and a Software Engineer.
