title: Empowerhack-ing A Story Part 2
---
How could I leave you all hanging? Just waiting with anticipation to find out how the rest of the [EmpowerHack](http://empowerhack.com) weekend went. Can you forgive me? ***PLEASE***

During the hackathon I did find a spare 30 mins between doing lunch runs, MC'ing, cutting brownies and fixing a whole lot of [`npm`](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/03/23/npm_left_pad_chaos/) issues on my machine and others to make another **2** [Storify's](https://storify.com/tanya_powell) just for you.

You can find the first one below and the second one [here](http://blog.tanyapowell.co.uk/Empowerhacking-A-Story-Part3/)

***ENJOY***
