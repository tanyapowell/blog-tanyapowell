For months now I've been meaning to try out [Storify](https://storify.com), but always get distracted. No more distractions! I've made the conscious effort to use it throughout the weekend for [EmpowerHack](http://empowerhack.com).

Here's one I made earlier. Let me know what you think and don't forget to follow me on [Storify](https://storify.com/tanya_powell).
