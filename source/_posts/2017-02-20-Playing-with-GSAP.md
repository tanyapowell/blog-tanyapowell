I've been working on an **Intro to SVG Animation** blog post on and off for a while now. So far I had only been researching the theory of it. This afternoon I had some free time (don't tell my team lead) and I thought, _I'm going to dive in head first into [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap) from Greensock_. And I really do mean head first! I had no idea what I wanted to animate, I had no vision and most importantly I didn't have a clue about using GSAP.

## What is GSAP? - I hear you say
I'll give a brief overview here. A more comprehensive description will be in the **Intro to SVG Animation** post. _GSAP is **a suite of tools for scripted animation.**_

So between meetings and doing a hotfix (there's no rest for the wicked) I managed to produce this little animation:

What do you think? Not bad for a first attempt if I say so myself ðŸ˜Š
